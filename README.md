# Data-Mining-ECE-280
Here's a repo for our two Final Project options:


### LIDO folder
- [SXS Gravitational Waveform Database
](https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/index.html)
- [Project proposal by Nicolas](https://www.overleaf.com/project/61533e45984d903839b456c0)

Includes: 
- horizons.h5 file that Sergi suggested we use
- LIDO.ipynb that opens the h5 file and re organizes in a 2 dimension data frame 


### WIKI folder: 
- [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/wikipedia-image-caption)


Includes: 
- Kaggle raw files (about 10% of original files, as they are huge) 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (soon to be added)
