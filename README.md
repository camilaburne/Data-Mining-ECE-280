# Data-Mining-ECE-280
Here's a repo for our two Final Project options:


### LIDO folder
Includes: 
- horizons.h5 file that Sergi suggested we use
- LIDO.ipynb that opens the h5 file and re organizes in a 2 dimension data frame 


### WIKI folder: 
Includes: 
- Kaggle raw files (about 10% of original files, as they are huge) 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (soon to be added)
