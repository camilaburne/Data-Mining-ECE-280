# Data-Mining-ECE-280
Here's a repo for our two Final Project options and extra resources:

### Linkedin Keras Course
- Keras course (1.5 hours) on [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-deep-learning-applications-with-keras-2-0/welcome?u=36306084) (should be accessible with UT account)


### LIDO folder
- [SXS Gravitational Waveform Database
](https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/index.html)
- [Project proposal by Nicolas](https://www.overleaf.com/project/61533e45984d903839b456c0)

Includes:
- horizons.h5 file that Sergi suggested we use
- LIDO.ipynb that opens the h5 file and re organizes in a 2 dimension data frame
- SXS.ipynb that opens about 100 h5 files. _Pending_: Continue with the rest of the files, and create functions to extract the relevant metadata.


### WIKI folder:
- [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/wikipedia-image-caption)


Includes:
- Kaggle raw files (about 10% of original files, as they are huge)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
